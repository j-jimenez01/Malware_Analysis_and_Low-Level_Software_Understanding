# Malware Analysis and Low-Level Software Understanding

This program is designed to explore malware analysis techniques and provide a comprehensive understanding of software at a low level. It utilizes the game Ultima 5 on DOSBox as a case study to showcase the intricacies of malware analysis and the significance of hex editors in inspecting binary code for potential security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the program goes beyond analysis and offers the capability to dynamically modify the game's values by creating a Python program that can edit the underlying hex code.

The program aims to achieve the following objectives:

- Gain insights into the techniques and methodologies employed in malware analysis.
- Develop a deeper understanding of software behavior at a low level.
- Demonstrate the importance of hex editors in unraveling binary code and identifying potential security risks.
- Empower users to actively engage with the program by utilizing a Python script to modify the values of Ultima 5 in real-time through hex code manipulation.

By combining these aspects, the program provides a unique opportunity to delve into the realm of malware analysis, low-level software comprehension, and dynamic hex editing. It offers practical insights into the underlying principles and enables users to experiment and explore the game's behavior through dynamic hex modifications.

## Description

The objective of this project is to provide insights into the process of malware analysis and examining compiled programs. By using Ultima 5 on DOSBox as an example, we can demonstrate how malware can infect compiled programs and the techniques employed by attackers. Additionally, we explore the use of hex editors to inspect and analyze binary code, allowing us to uncover potential security vulnerabilities.

Moreover, the project takes a step further by creating a Python program that enables us to modify the game's values. By leveraging Python, we can dynamically edit the hex code of Ultima 5, allowing us to customize various aspects of the game.
